      ### Best Practices for AXI Protocols
      - **AXI Protocol Compliance**: Ensure that your design adheres to the AXI protocol specifications, including proper management of read/write channels, ready/valid handshakes, and address arbitration.
      - **AXI-DMA Integration**: For high-performance DMA transfers, integrate Vivado's **AXI-DMA IP core**. Configure the DMA for burst transfers to maximize throughput and minimize bus contention.
      - **Backpressure Handling**: Implement robust backpressure handling to prevent data loss during high-speed transfers. Ensure that your design can handle cases where the downstream module is not ready to accept data.
      - **Buffer Alignment**: For maximum efficiency, ensure proper buffer alignment when transferring data between the AXI-DMA engine and memory. Misaligned buffers can result in additional overhead and reduced throughput.
      - **Latency and Throughput Optimization**: Use pipelining and burst transfers to balance latency and throughput in AXI systems. Leverage Vivado's performance analysis tools to identify and mitigate bottlenecks.

      ### Debugging and Verification
      - **Simulation of AXI Interfaces**: Use Vivado's AXI protocol checker to ensure your AXI transactions are correct. Perform simulations to verify that the data transfer mechanism works under different scenarios and with different traffic loads.
      - **Real-Time Debugging with ILA**: When debugging in real hardware, use Vivado's Integrated Logic Analyzer (ILA) to capture AXI transactions in real time. This helps verify the correct implementation of the AXI protocol and DMA transfers.
